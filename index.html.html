<li style="font-family:impact;font-size: 20px; color: Black; background-color:powderblue;"><b> Punggol Park</li></b>
<p style="font-family:impact;background-color:powderblue;"> Begin your journey along Serangoon Park Connector and explore Punggol Park’s serene
5-hectare lake. A familiar place of recreation for
families in Hougang, this park houses a number
of facilities that cater to both the young and old,
including play and fitness equipment and even a
plaza for tai chi sessions. Here, a bicycle kiosk is
available where you can rent a bicycle for your
cycling adventure.
Adjacent to Punggol Park is Sungei Pinang, a
tributary of the longer 8km Serangoon Reservoir
in northeastern Singapore. Sungei Pinang is more
than just a canal lined with concrete banks. Many
waterside birds can be seen fishing here when the
water levels is low. <br></p>

<b><li style="font-family:impact;font-size: 20px; color: black; background-color:powderblue;"> Sengkang Riverside Park </b></li>

<p style="font-family:impact;background-color:powderblue;"> Sengkang Riverside Park is home to a unique
wetland that was constructed to collect and filter
rainwater naturally through its aquatic plants.
Sengkang Floating Wetland (built and maintained by
PUB) is separate from Sengkang Riverside Park.
Running along the perimeter of the wetland is a
Fruit Tree Trail that features 16 types of fruit trees
ranging from the familiar mangosteen, pomelo,
mango, lime and starfruit, to the more exotic Pond
Apple, Island Lychee, Sweetsop, Java Olive and
Custard Apple.  </p>

<b><li style="font-family:impact;font-size: 20px; color: black; background-color:powderblue;"> Punggol Waterway Park </b></li>

<p style="font-family:impact;background-color:powderblue;"> Take a detour to the ‘Venice of Punggol’. Integrated
within a 4.2km waterway, this beautiful park is a
milestone in the transformation of Punggol Town
into a waterfront town of the 21st century.
Take a history lesson from the heritage panels
and Heartwave Wall, where a series of bronze plates
recounts Punggol’s development from a plantation
area to what you see today.
Admire a sunset on Jewel Bridge, whose design
was inspired by a jewel atop a ring. Walk across
the steel Adventure Bridge, designed to look like a wooden suspension bridge that blends in with
the park’s natural setting. Experience the idyllic
atmosphere of old Punggol on Kelong Bridge. Its
design incorporates visual elements of a kelong, a
traditional offshore platform built on stilts and posts,
to reflect Punggol’s heritage as a fishing village. The
design of Wave Bridge reflects the undulating terrain
of the vicinity. Finally, marking the eastern end of
the waterway, the elevated Sunrise Bridge conveys
the rustic flavour of its surroundings with a modern
twist. Get on this structure to enjoy a good view of
the sunrise.  </p>

<li style="font-family:impact;font-size: 20px; color: Black; background-color:powderblue;"><b> Sungei Serangoon Park Connector </li></b>
<p style="font-family:impact;background-color:powderblue;"> Cross the Sungei Pinang footbridge and take in
picturesque views of Serangoon Reservoir as you
travel along this greenway. The landscape around
Sungei Serangoon Park Connector holds a bioswale
– a natural, chemical-free filtration system for
cleansing rainwater. Blending beautifully into the
greenery, these shallow troughs of vegetation help
control floods by slowing down surface runoff.
Look out for vibrant plant life in the bioswale
such as the Coral Plant (Russelia equisetiformis),
which has an explosive display of scarlet flowers
growing in clusters all year round, hence its other
common name Firecracker Plant. Also keep a
lookout for a particular plant with purplish, feathery
stalks that can reach a height of 1.2m. The distinctive
Purple Fountain Grass (Pennisetum setaceum) is
used in many parts of the world as an ornamental
plant for horticulture and landscaping. <br></p>

<b><li style="font-family:impact;font-size: 20px; color: black; background-color:powderblue;"> Punggol Park Connector </b></li>

<p style="font-family:impact;background-color:powderblue;"> Running parallel to Punggol Reservoir, the Punggol
Park Connector links to Punggol Waterway, passes
by Sengkang Floating Wetland, and ends at Gerald
Drive. The stretch boasts of a rich blend of coastal
and mangrove trees lining both sides of the track.
Butterfly-attracting plants, including the brightly
coloured Common Lantana (Lantana camara)
and unassuming Blue Snakeweed (Stachytarpheta
indica), are found along various stretches, making
the journey delightful with the numerous butterflies
fluttering around the area.   </p>

<b><li style="font-family:impact;font-size: 20px; color: black; background-color:powderblue;"> Buangkok Park Connector </b></li>

<p style="font-family:impact;background-color:powderblue;"> This busy park connector serves a variety of users,
from commuters to jogging enthusiasts. It runs
along residential estates and connects to Punggol
Park via Serangoon Park Connector. You may catch
a ride home from Buangkok MRT Station, which is
just a short distance away  </p>

<b style ="background-color:powderblue;font-family:forte"><u>Common Birds in the Loop</u></b></h3>
<a href="#top"><p style="text-align:center; font-size: 15px;" >Back to top of page</a></p>

<img src="bird1.jpg" width=100%>
<p style="font-family:impact;background-color:powderblue;"> Teeming with biodiversity, the loop sees many
waterside birds fishing here when water levels
are low. Here are some common ones that you
might see.
Identify the Collared Kingfisher (Todiramphus
chloris) with its recognisable loud, laughing call.
The striated Little Heron (Butorides striatus) might
be seen hunched in an egg-like shape, looking
intently for prey at the water’s edge.
Catch glimpses of the elegant resident Grey
Heron (Ardea cinerea), the migratory Little
Egret (Egretta garzetta) standing on one foot,
and the White-breasted Waterhen (Amaurornis
phoenicurus). The White-throated Kingfisher
(Halcyon smyrnensis) makes its presence known
with its loud calls and striking blue plumage.
Move in to observe the bold Olive-backed
Sunbird (Nectarinia jugularis) sipping nectar
from flowering plants; just remember to keep
still and be quiet! </p>
